This script generates a propeller.step from an APC propeller geometry file as found here: 
https://www.apcprop.com/technical-information/file-downloads/.
The propeller is generated in 3 parts: Hub, Blade and Propeller.
(Visualization via ocp_Viewer (Visual Studio Code only) or CQ-Editor)
The hub geometry is generated based on the propeller name. The hub geometry can also be defined manually if inferred incorrectly.
The blade is generated based on the APC propeller geometry file. Supported airfoil types are NACA, E63 and CLARK-Y.
The transition part between the hub and the blade is a loft (splined) between the first 2 airfoils and 2 ellipses at the hub center.
The propeller is generated by combining the hub, blade and transition part.
The propeller is exported as a .step to the local folder.

# Usage instructions (in main.py):
Select the APC propeller geometry file and change the filename variable to the path of the file.
If necessary, define the hub geometry manually or set counterclockwise = False.
Run the script!

# Required Packages:
