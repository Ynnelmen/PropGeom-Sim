This script generates a propeller.step from an APC propeller geometry file. The propeller is generated in 3 parts: Hub, Blade and Propeller
(Visualization via ocp_Viewer (Visual Studio Code only) or CQ-Editor)
The hub geometry is generated based on the propeller name. The hub geometry can also be defined manually if inferred incorrectly.
The blade is generated based on the APC propeller geometry file. Supported airfoil types are NACA, E63 and CLARK-Y.
The transition part between the hub and the blade is a loft (splined) between the first 2 airfoils and 2 ellipses at the hub center.
The propeller is generated by combining the hub, blade and transition part.
The propeller is exported as a .step (and .stl file in the "Generated Propeller Exports" folder)

# Usage instructions (in main.py):
Select the APC propeller geometry file and change the filename variable to the path of the file
Set the hub geometry type to the propeller name or define the hub geometry manually
Run the script
